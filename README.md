# NLP Assignment 1
In this assignment we are classifying medical and non-medical documents. Firstly, we get some sampled annotated keywords in order to use them as the topics for the documents we are inserting directly from wikipedia with the help of wikipedia APIs. Secondly, we detect the most common words in both medical and non-medical documents, we are going to use these words as features in the CountVectorizer of the classifier model. Lastly, in this assignment we are going to use Majority Class Naive Classifier for the classification of the documents. At the end we also use a sample pdf from wikipedia to test our model.
